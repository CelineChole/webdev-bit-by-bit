Numerous students asked me a similar question: 'where so I start if I want to build my portfolio site'. I wanted to try to answer all the sub-questions following this big question.

## Do I need a database?

Short answer it is unlikely you do. Portfolio website are static and all your content can be stored directly in your files.

## Where should I deploy my site?

There are a lot of possible options out there. [Firebase](https://cloud.google.com/build/docs/deploying-builds/deploy-firebase) is a very easy option. You could also use Heroku or [surge](https://surge.sh/) whit the caveat that if you want to use your own custom domain surge isn't free.

## Do I need to use React?

Although you can use React you probably don't need it and want to explore other options such as Gatsby which as great [templates](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/starters/?) to get you started quickly.

[Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/) is also a great option to explore. Here is a great article on [overengineered resumes](https://mxb.dev/blog/eleventy-resume-builder/).

Don't shoot for perfection on the first try. What is important is to have something live, it doesn't need to be perfect but it needs to look professional. Something simple is great, you can always spend more time improving it in the future.
