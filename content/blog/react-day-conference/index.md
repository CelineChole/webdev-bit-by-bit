I had the opportunity to attend React Day in New-York, here is some of my notes. 

## React Hooks Tips and Tricks

Hooks are included into React, it is also possible to create custom hooks. A lot already exist online and you should take the benefit of them:
- [react-hooks-helper](https://github.com/revelcw/react-hooks-helper) is a custom React Hooks library that gives you custom hooks for your code.
- [Collection of React Hooks](https://nikgraf.github.io/react-hooks/) is another React Hooks library

`useStep` can be used to create a carousel.

[`use-dark-mode`](https://github.com/donavon/use-dark-mode) can be used to easily switch an app to the night mode.

Custom hooks can be used inside other custom hooks.

## Full Stack React in the Era of Serverless Computing
#### Nader Dabit - Amazon Web Services

[Full-Stack Development in the Era of Serverless Computing](https://medium.com/@dabit3/full-stack-development-in-the-era-of-serverless-computing-c1e49bba8580)

Talk re serverless technologies are changing what it means to be a full-stack developer.

Because of the rise of SPAs, more complex data concerns, multiple device targets and increased expectations of user experience, client-side development has gotten more complex over the past decade or so. Increase expectation for front-end developer.

Evolution of computing over the past few years:
- On Premises
- Cloud
- Serverless computing: FaaS (Function as a Service) + BaaS (Backend as a Service)

    Serverless becomes easier
    Serverless becomes cheaper than serverful
    Serverful becoming relatively less important
    Serverless becomes the default computing paradigm of the cloud era

- What's next? Serviceful Serverless
    Service full service
    No server operations
    Cordless
    No need to manage uptime
    Scales seemlessly...
 
A few examples of serviceful services include Auth0 / Amazon Cognito(managed authentication), Algolia (managed search), Contentful (content infrastructure), AWS AppSync / Cloud Firestore (managed API services), Amazon Lex / Rekognition / Textract (machine learning services), and Cloudinary (managed image & video hosting service).
 
Benefits

- Front end developers move further up the stack
- Increase developer efficiency and velocity
- Decreased complexity
- More secure, reliable, scalable

Team organized by feature rather than platform or stack.
