I had the opportunity to attend React Day in New-York, here is an overview of the conference. 

## React Hooks Tips and Tricks

Hooks are included into React, it is also possible to create custom hooks. A lot already exist online and you should take the benefit of them:
- [react-hooks-helper](https://github.com/revelcw/react-hooks-helper) is a custom React Hooks library that gives you custom hooks for your code.
- [Collection of React Hooks](https://nikgraf.github.io/react-hooks/) is another React Hooks library

`useStep` can be used to create a carousel.

[`use-dark-mode`](https://github.com/donavon/use-dark-mode) can be used to easily switch an app to the night mode.

Custom hooks can be used inside other custom hooks.
