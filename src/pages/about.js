          <p>
            I am CÃ©line, a full stack web developer that completed a tour of
            duty in the Intellectual Property field as an Excel-wielding
            business analyst.
          </p>
          <p>
            I work in a bootcamp as a web instructor.
            <br />
            Web dev bit by bit is a collection of resources that I found useful
            for me or for the students I work with.
          </p>
          <p>
            For the past 5 years I worked in the Intellectual Property industry
            as a Project Manager and later as a Business Analyst. I relocated to
            the US from London and took the opportunity to reimagine my career
            and work in the tech industry.
          </p>
          <p>A bit more about me:</p>
          <p>
            I love reading while drinking a cup of tea (this is my British
            side).
            <br />
            I also love cooking (this must be my French heritage), especially
            baking.
            <br />
            <br />I am also a yoga-addict, practicing nearly every day. If you
            would like some inspiration to practice, I created a library
            grouping YouTube videos I have been using:{" "}
