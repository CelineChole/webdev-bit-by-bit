                  I am CÃ©line, a full stack web developer that completed a tour
                  of duty in the Intellectual Property field as an
                  Excel-wielding business analyst.

              <p>
                I work in a bootcamp as a web instructor.
                <br />
                Web dev bit by bit is a collection of resources that I found
                useful for me or for the students I work with.
              </p>
              <p>
                For the past 5 years I worked in the Intellectual Property
                industry as a Project Manager and later as a Business Analyst. I
                relocated to the US from London and took the opportunity to
                reimagine my career and work in the tech industry.
              </p>
              <p>A bit more about me:</p>
              <p>
                I love reading while drinking a cup of tea (this is my British
                side).
                <br />
                I also love cooking (this must be my French heritage),
                especially baking.
                <br />
                <br />I am also a yoga-addict, practicing nearly every day. If
                you would like some inspiration to practice, I created a library
                grouping YouTube videos I have been using:{" "}
