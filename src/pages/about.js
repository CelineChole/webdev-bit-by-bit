            Most articles focus on a specific topic or idea, but some posts are

            A bit more about me
          </h3>
          <p>
            I am CÃ©line, a full stack web developer that completed a tour of
            duty in the Intellectual Property field as an Excel-wielding
            business analyst.
          </p>
          <p>
            For the past 5 years I worked in the Intellectual Property industry
            as a Project Manager and later as a Business Analyst. I relocated to
            the US from London and took the opportunity to reimagine my career
            and work in the tech industry.

            I love reading while drinking a cup of tea (this is my British
            side). I also love cooking (this must be my French heritage),
            especially baking. I am also a yoga-addict, practicing nearly every
            day. If you would like some inspiration to practice, I created a
            library grouping YouTube videos I have been using:{" "}
